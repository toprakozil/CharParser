TASK:
In this case, you will implement a console application that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string cleared of duplicates. The result should be ordered from the most repeated character to the least repeated character. If they have the same degree, sort them in alphabetical order.

Execution:
> ./app bcabaa
> abc

Sample-1:
Input: bcabaa
Output: abc
Description: Input has 3 a, 2 b and 1 c. So, output should be a,b and c.

Sample2: 
Input: edceadec
Output: ecda
Description: Input has 3 e, 2 d, 2c and 1a. Since d and c have same degree, the correct order should be c and d.
